## User Experience

I worked on perfecting details like animations and how the lock screen reacts to different interactions to give the user the most immersive experience possible, with details like:

- Wave animation when plugging in the charger.

- Smooth transitions when opening, closing and navigating On-screen Settings.

- Smooth animations on the clock and notifications.

- Media control animations.

- Visual response to overscroll and touching the screen.

- Dynamic interface elements such as status icons and notification container.

## Features under development

- "Clear all" button for notifications.
